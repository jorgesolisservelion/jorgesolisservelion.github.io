Hi, I’m Jorge from Lima, Perú! 

I'm an Industrial Engineer and Business Analytics MSc candidate with a rich background in leveraging advanced data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to drive strategic decisions and operational improvements. I excel in translating complex data into actionable business insights, optimizing processes across sectors like finance, banking, oil & gas, insurance, and marketing.

My expertise encompasses not only advanced analytics, programming (SQL, Python, R) and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau, but also in-depth business analysis and marketing strategies. Demonstrated success in leading high-impact projects and teams to achieve significant improvements in processes, cost reduction, and revenue growth. Committed to innovation through agile methodologies and a data-driven approach, I aim to contribute to growth-oriented companies in the United States by bridging the gap between data science and strategic business objectives.
